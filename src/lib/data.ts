  bio: "I’m an AI/ML engineer in the making with a strong focus on agentic AI systems, computer vision, and applied machine learning. I’ve built end-to-end AI solutions—from YOLO-based disaster response pipelines to agentic debuggers that reason over ML experiments—through industry and research internships. I enjoy turning complex ideas into scalable, real-world systems and have led multiple award-winning projects recognized by IEEE and national hackathons. Currently, I’m exploring how autonomous agents, RAG pipelines, and multimodal AI can be used to build practical, high-impact products.",
